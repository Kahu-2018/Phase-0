# What did I do well this week?

I did finished coding assignment part in the earlier at the weeks. I like that I can help people from my cohort move forward at their assignments.

# What could I have done to improve?

Oral Communication is still my weakness. Unlike writing, there is no luxury of time to slowly thinking through how and what I should express certain thing. Look like the only solution is keep on practicing.

I was not really doing in a good speed when at the later part of the Sprint assignment that involve a lot of reading and writing. I guess "keep on practicing" is the only answer.
