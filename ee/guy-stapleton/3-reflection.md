What did I do well this week?
<ul>
<li>Working on improving my typing speed. Spending time practicing not looking at they keyboard while typing and have a clear goal of where I wwant to be by start of dev academy.</li>
<li>Learnt how to implement Font Awesome for the social media icons for my redesigned website</li>
<li>Using that python SimpleHTTPServer trick all the time now rather than browsing to the file location</li>
<li>Wrote my first code snippet in Atom!</li>
</ul>

What could I have done to improve?
<ul>
<li>A lot of my layout problems are caused by missing div tags. I might need to improve my tidiness. Also, I tend to write the css for layout by instinct but often end u with results that I don't expect. I need to brush up on that. I also would benefit from maybe working things out on paper more rather than just type away. I also haven't been validating my code so need</li>
<li>I need to spend some time looking at design and breaking them down</li>
<li>I was pretty lazy when implementing Font Awesome and didn't really read the documentation properly. I tried to find an example of how to use it and went with that instead. Not a great habit to get into</li>
</ul>
